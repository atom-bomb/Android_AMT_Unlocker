Hi Kids,

Here is a little Android application to unlock the front door at Ace Monster Toys.

It requires internet permissions as well as a working internet connection on your android device.
For the door to actually unlock you will need to have previously configured username, password and door PIN on
the Ace Monster Toys web server.

See LICENSE for details and don't blame me if the guy's a nut.
